Overview
cbin (Cloud-Based Intelligent Bin) is a tool designed to help recover accidentally deleted files in a secure, reliable, and cloud-integrated manner. 
It operates on a master-agent model and is built with DevOps environments and modern cloud infrastructure in mind.

The goal of cbin is to reduce the risk of accidental data loss by capturing deleted files in real time, compressing, encrypting, and securely storing them in a designated cloud storage location. 
Users can later browse and recover these files via a simple and intuitive command-line interface (CLI).

Key Features
Accidental File Deletion Protection: Captures files deleted from the system in real-time.

Master-Agent Architecture: Lightweight agents run on client machines while the master node manages storage and recovery processes.

Cloud Storage Integration: Deleted files are backed up to supported cloud providers, ensuring durability and availability.

Compression and Encryption: Files are stored in a compressed and encrypted format to save space and maintain confidentiality.

CLI-Based Recovery: Easily browse, search, and restore deleted files using a powerful command-line interface.

Stay tuned!
